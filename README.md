# AV-NMP-Motion-Estimation-Mapping

## ---- Description ---- ##
This is my submission for the AV Motion Estimation Mapping team. The project is unfinished with scattered attempts and edits throughout the files.

## ---- Files ---- ##
Most of my edits are in two files:
  - z5208628_ekf.yaml
  - dual_ekf_navsat_example.launch.py

These files are located in (respectively):
- AV-NMP-Motion-Estimation-Mapping/redback_ws/install/robot_localization/share/robot_localization/launch/
- AV-NMP-Motion-Estimation-Mapping/redback_ws/install/robot_localization/share/robot_localization/params/

Thanks for the chance. I did my best to learn ROS with this being my first time and it was a rough experience but I had fun.
